# ST-Tree with Interpretability for Multivariate Time Series Classification

Still updating.

This repository contains the code for the paper "ST-Tree with Interpretability for Multivariate Time Series Classification", which is accepted by NN. You can find it in arxiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11620).

The main components of this project are:

1. run_UEA_exp.py: This script generates the interpretability figures for the ST-Tree model.
2. run_UEA_ntree.py: This script trains and evaluates the ST-Tree model on the Epilepsy dataset from the Time Series Classification website.
3. The dataset can be downloaded from the Time Series Classification website (http://timeseriesclassification.com).
